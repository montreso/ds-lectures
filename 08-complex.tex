\subsection{Degree statistics}

\begin{frame}{Degree statistics (1)}

\begin{definition}[Degree]
\BI
\item The \alert{degree} $k_i$ of node $i$ is the number of edges the node has to other nodes
\item In this lecture, we will only consider undirected graphs
\item Called \alert{local centrality} in social network analysis
\item Measures how important is a node with respect to its neighbors
\EI

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Degree statistics (2)}

\begin{definition}[Degree distribution]
\BI
\item The average degree of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is $\langle k \rangle = \frac{|E|}{|V|}$ 
\item $P(k)$ is the probability that a random node has degree $k$
\item The probability distribution gives an idea of the spread in the number of links the nodes have
\EI

\subsection{Distance statistics}

\begin{frame}{Distance statistics (1)}

\begin{definition}[Path length]
The \alert{path length} $d(i,j)$, or \alert{goedesic distance}, between two nodes $i$ and $j$ is the length
of the shortest path connecting them. 
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{distance}
\end{figure}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Distance statistics (2)}
	
\begin{definition}[Average path length]
The \alert{average path length} of a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ is defined as:
\[
  \Path(G) = \frac{1}{|V|(|V|-1)} \sum_{i,j \in V, i \neq j} d(i,j)
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{diameter}
\caption{(a) $\Path(G) = (4 \cdot ((2+2+2+1)/8) + 1)/5=1.6$. (b) $\Path(G) = 1$}
\end{figure}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Distance statistics (3)}

\begin{definition}[Diameter]
The \alert{diameter} is the maximal shortest path between any two vertices:
\[
  \Diam(G) = \max \{ d(i,j) : i,j \in V \}
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{diameter}

\subsection{Clustering coefficient}

\begin{frame}{Clustering coefficient (1)}

\begin{definition}[Induced graphs]
The subgraph $G_i=(V_i, E_i)$ \alert{induced} by node $i$ over a graph $G=(V,E)$ 
  is given by the neighbors of $i$ and the edges linking them:
  \begin{align*}
	 V_i &= \{ j : j \in V \wedge (i,j) \in E \} \\
	 E_i &= \{ (i,j) : i,j \in V_i \wedge (i,j) \in E \}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Clustering coefficient (2)}

\begin{definition}[Local clustering coefficient]
The \alert{local clustering coefficient} of node $i$ in graph $G$ is the
  ratio between the size of $|E_i|$ and the number of all potential edges
  that link two nodes in $V_i$:
  \[
     CC(G,i) = \frac{|E_i|}{|V_i|(|V_i|-1)/2} = \frac{2|E_i|}{|V_i|(|V_i|-1)}
  \]

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Clustering coefficient (3)}

\begin{definition}[Clustering coefficient]

The \alert{clustering coefficient} of graph $G$ is the average over the local 
  clustering coefficient of all nodes in the graph
  \[
     CC(G) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i \in V} CC(G,i)
  \]

{\footnotesize
A fascinating game grew out of this discussion. One of us suggested performing
the following experiment to prove that the population of the Earth is closer
together now than they have ever been before. We should select any person from
the 1.5 billion inhabitants of the Earth—anyone, anywhere at all. He bet us
that, using no more than five individuals, one of whom is a personal
acquaintance, he could contact the selected individual using nothing except
the network of personal acquaintances.}

\section{Graph modeling}

\subsection{Random graphs}

\begin{frame}{Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi Random (E-R) Networks}

\begin{definition}[Random Graph]
Given a network of $N$ nodes, connect each pair $(p_i,p_j)$ of nodes
with probability $p$
\end{definition}

\bigskip
Two different realizations for $N = 5$ and $p = 0.5$

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{random}
\end{figure}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Some properties of E-R networks}

\structure{Given an E-R graph with $N$ nodes and probability $p$}:

\BIL
\item Expected number of edges: $|E| = pN(N-1)/2$	
\item Expected average degree: $\langle k \rangle = 2|E|/N = p(N-1) \approx pN$
\item Degree distribution: $P(k) = \binom{N-1}{k} p^k(1-p)^{N-1-k}$ (binomial)
\item In the limit of large $N$, $\Diam(G) = \frac{\log N}{\log \langle k \rangle}$
\item Average path length is bounded by diameter
\item Clustering coefficient: $CC(G) = p$
\EI

\note{
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}	
\BI
\item This probability represents the number of ways in which $k$ edges can be
drawn from a certain node: the probability of $k$ edges is $p^k$, the
probability of the absence of additional edges is $(1-p)^{N-1-k}$k, and there
are $\binom{N-1}{k}$, equivalent ways of selecting those $k$ edges.
\item Random graphs tend to have small diameters, provided $p$ is not too
small. The reason for this is that a random graph is likely to be spreading:
with large probability the number of nodes at a distance $l$ from a given node
is not much smaller than $\langle k \rangle^l$. Equating $\langle k \rangle^l$
with $N$ we find that the diameter is proportional to $l = \log N / \log k$.
\item If we consider a node in a random graph and its nearest neighbors, the
probability that two of these neighbors are connected is equal to the
probability that two randomly selected nodes are connected.

\note{
 
\url{http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~nasmith/erm/}

Most of the computer science curriculum teaches you:
\BI
\item how to be a good engineer (e.g., computer programming, software engineering, and object-oriented
design), 
\item how to think about problems abstractly (e.g., algorithms, data
structures, theory of network communication, and automata theory)
\item how computing can be applied to solve various problems (e.g., vision, speech and
language processing, and transaction processing systems)
\item how computer systems work (e.g., operating systems). 
\EI

A different view is that computational objects (like computer programs) are
complex systems that sometimes need to be studied as one would study a
biological or physical system: by rolling up your sleeves and running
controlled experiments.
